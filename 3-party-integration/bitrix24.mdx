üì∏ Figure 5 Convertalk and Bitrix24 integration




‚Ä¢	Send Lead to CRM: Map Convertalk Chat Flow fields ‚Üí Bitrix24 CRM parameters.
This interface defines how Convertalk fields collected during a chat flow are sent and recorded in Bitrix24 as CRM data.
Within the Send Lead to CRM section, each question or variable captured by the bot can be paired with a specific Bitrix24 parameter for seamless synchronization.
 
üì∏ Figure 6 Birix24 Lead mapping

Actions shown in the configuration:
1.	Question mapping:
The Convertalk Bot‚Äôs question ‚ÄúDo you want to know‚Ä¶‚Ä¶?‚Äù is mapped to the Bitrix24 field Note, so any user response to that question will be saved in the CRM as a note or, any other from the list.
 




2.	Dynamic atributes mapping:
o	The Language attribute is mapped Source Description, allowing you to track the user‚Äôs contact channel.
 
o	The Business Need attribute is mapped to Comment, so context or intent gathered during the conversation is logged directly in the deal or lead comments.
o	 
3.	Static attribute mapping:
A constant key‚Äìvalue pair (kre01 ‚Üí "Update Completed") is added as a static attribute.
This is useful for tagging leads with specific automation flags or workflow identifiers when sending them to Bitrix24.
4.	Testing and confirmation:
The Test Lead button on the right allows you to instantly send a mock record to Bitrix24 and confirm that the mapping is functioning correctly.
5.	Saving changes:
Click Update to store all mappings.
The integration immediately becomes active for the selected chatbot once the update is saved.







‚Ä¢	Bitrix24 Attribute Mapping: Link Bitrix24 attributes (Deal, Contact, Lead) ‚Üí Convertalk variables.
The module enables Convertalk to synchronize CRM data dynamically, ensuring that key Bitrix24 attributes (such as deal status, tags, or assigned users) stay aligned with your chatbot logic.
This mapping makes it possible for Convertalk to read and update Bitrix24 records automatically during the conversation flow ‚Äî maintaining a live connection between both systems.
 
üì∏ Figure 7 Mapping Bitrix24 CRM attributes to Convertalk parameters for data synchronization
How it works:
Each row defines a pairing between a Convertalk attribute and a Bitrix24 parameter.
When Convertalk sends or receives data from Bitrix24, it uses these mappings to translate field names and keep both sides consistent.
Actions shown in this configuration example:
‚Ä¢	Tags Mapping:
The Convertalk tag ‚ÄúRocket‚Äù is linked to a Bitrix24 tag field.
Tags help classify leads or deals (e.g., campaign, product line, or interest level) and are automatically created in Bitrix24 if they don‚Äôt already exist.
‚Ä¢	Status and Pipeline Mapping:
Convertalk updates the deal or lead stage in Bitrix24 based on the conversation flow or chatbot logic.
When a customer reaches a key point during the interaction ‚Äî for example, New Opportunity, Needs Assessment, or Free Trial Setup ‚Äî Convertalk automatically updates the corresponding Deal Stage (STAGE_ID) in Bitrix24 through a one-way synchronization.
This configuration keeps the CRM pipeline aligned with the customer‚Äôs progress in WhatsApp conversations, ensuring that Bitrix24 always reflects the most recent stage reached through Convertalk.
Typical examples include moving a deal to Needs Assessment when a prospect confirms interest, or updating to Won when a renewal is completed through chat.
Note: The current integration operates in a single direction (Convertalk ‚Üí Bitrix24).

‚Ä¢	Convertalk and Bitrix24 share aligned stage definitions to ensure both systems reflect the same customer progression.
When a conversation in Convertalk reaches a milestone (for example, New Opportunity, Needs Assessment, or Free Trial Setup), the integration automatically updates the corresponding Deal Stage (STAGE_ID) or Status in Bitrix24.
Likewise, when a stage is modified in Bitrix24 ‚Äî for instance, a deal is moved from Needs Assessment to Won ‚Äî Convertalk‚Äôs Inbox Chat Status instantly mirrors that change.
This two-way synchronization maintains consistency between chat engagement and CRM deal tracking, allowing Convertalk to deliver real-time visibility and analytics without duplicating CRM functionality.
Bitrix24 remains the system of record for all pipeline operations, while Convertalk acts as an intelligent conversational layer that mirrors deal progress and supports automated follow-ups and analytics.
Tip: Use identical stage names and hierarchy in both Convertalk and Bitrix24 (for example, New Opportunity, Needs Assessment, Free Trial Setup, Won, Lost) to ensure accurate synchronization and clean reporting across both platforms.
‚Ä¢	Assigned Users:
The Assigned Users parameter links the lead or deal to a specific Bitrix24 user (in this example, RIPUZ SAS).
This routing ensures that new conversations or deals are automatically assigned to the correct sales or support representative.
‚Ä¢	Saving and Synchronization:
o	Click Update to save your mappings.
o	Click Sync to test live synchronization.
Convertalk will verify that both systems recognize the linked parameters and confirm successful mapping.





‚Ä¢	Automated Deal Creation: Auto-create Deals directly from chat interactions.
The module allows Convertalk to generate or update deals in Bitrix24 automatically, based on the answers captured during a chatbot conversation.
Each question defined in Convertalk can be mapped to a specific Bitrix24 field (identified by its unique UF_CRM_ parameter), ensuring that deal data is continuously enriched as the chat progresses.
 
üì∏ Figure 8 Automatic deal creation and field mapping from Convertalk conversation questions to Bitrix24 Deal fields.
How it works:
As the chatbot asks predefined questions (for example, ‚ÄúCould you please share your company name?‚Äù or ‚ÄúLet me know what service you need‚Äù), the customer‚Äôs answers are automatically assigned to their respective Bitrix24 deal fields.
 Each question is linked to a Bitrix24 parameter such as:
‚Ä¢	UF_CRM_1759610251 ‚Üí Company Name
‚Ä¢	UF_CRM_681784764369 ‚Üí Service Interest

When the conversation reaches a trigger point (for example, a user confirms interest or shares key details), Convertalk either creates a new Deal or updates an existing Deal in Bitrix24 using these field values.

The Update button saves all mappings, activating the automation. From that moment, every new conversation that reaches those questions will automatically populate or update the CRM.
Benefits:
‚Ä¢	Eliminates manual deal creation by sales teams.
‚Ä¢	Keeps Bitrix24 always up-to-date with live data captured in chat.
‚Ä¢	Maintains full traceability ‚Äî each field in Bitrix24 corresponds to a real user input from WhatsApp.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Webhook and API Extension (Advanced)

Convertalk IA Bot / Flow

üéØ Objective
The Convertalk IA Bot / Flow architecture enables companies to automate and centralize their customer interactions across WhatsApp Business API (WABA) and any connected CRM.
This design eliminates manual intervention in common service processes ‚Äî such as plan renewals, ticket status checks, and follow-up notifications ‚Äî by connecting Convertalk‚Äôs intelligent chat flows with the CRM‚Äôs native REST API via secure webhooks.
Through this automation:
‚Ä¢	Clients receive instant, personalized responses on WhatsApp.
‚Ä¢	CRMs are automatically updated or queried in real time.
‚Ä¢	Agents are notified only when human interaction is required.
The result is a seamless, two-way communication loop between customer, Convertalk IA Bot / Flow, and CRM, improving operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall service continuity.
















üß≠ Operational Guide ‚Äî Convertalk IA Bot / Flow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Entry Point: WhatsApp
1.	The client opens WhatsApp and sees two buttons: Renew Plan and Check Ticket.
2.	The client clicks one (or sends an equivalent message).
3.	The event from WhatsApp Business API (WABA) reaches the configured inbound webhook.________________________________________
2Ô∏è‚É£    Core Engine: Convertalk IA Bot / Flow
4.	Convertalk IA Bot / Flow receives the event and detects which option was selected.
5.	It splits the logic into two branches:________________________________________
3Ô∏è‚É£ Branch A ‚Äî Renew Plan
6.	The Convertalk outbound webhook triggers a call to the CRM webhook for plan renewal:
o	In Convertalk (Developers ‚Üí Webhooks), configure your CRM destination as:
https://your.company.com/webhook/crm-renewal
7.	The CRM webhook receives the call and runs its internal REST logic:
o	Updates the Deal/Task (e.g., STAGE_ID=NEW, adds comment, etc.).
8.	The CRM replies with a success response (e.g., { "result": true }).
9.	Convertalk sends the user a confirmation via WhatsApp:
o	‚Äú‚úÖ Your renewal has been successfully registered.‚Äù
10.	Flow ends in Convertalk IA Bot / Flow.________________________________________
4Ô∏è‚É£ Branch B ‚Äî Check Ticket
11.	The Convertalk outbound webhook calls the CRM webhook for data retrieval:
o	In Convertalk (Developers ‚Üí Webhooks), configure:
https://your.company.com/webhook/crm-query
12.	The CRM webhook runs an internal REST GET request:
o	Fetches fields like TITLE, STAGE_ID, UF_CRM_DUE_DATE.
13.	The CRM returns the data in JSON format.
14.	Convertalk processes and formats the response, then replies to the user:
o	‚Äúüîç Your service status:
‚Ä¢ Title: {{TITLE}}
‚Ä¢ Stage: {{STAGE_ID}}
‚Ä¢ Due date: {{UF_CRM_DUE_DATE}}‚Äù
15.	Flow ends in Convertalk IA Bot / Flow.________________________________________
5Ô∏è‚É£ Webhook Pairing (Match)
‚Ä¢	CRM ‚Üí Outbound Webhook: Create it first inside your CRM (e.g., Bitrix24 or another). It generates a URL.
‚Ä¢	Convertalk ‚Üí Outbound Webhook: Paste that CRM URL in Convertalk (Developers ‚Üí Webhooks).
o	Renewal: https://your.company.com/webhook/crm-renewal
o	Query: https://your.company.com/webhook/crm-query
Core idea: Convertalk Webhook ‚Üí CRM Webhook ‚Üí CRM REST API.
The CRM performs the actual update or query internally.________________________________________
6Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation Notes
‚Ä¢	Always use generic URLs in documentation (avoid internal domains).
‚Ä¢	If your CRM supports outbound webhooks, you can also push changes back to Convertalk for proactive updates.
‚Ä¢	Keep naming consistent: always use Convertalk IA Bot / Flow in every node or label.________________________________________
7Ô∏è‚É£ Quick Checklist (for publication)
‚Ä¢	WABA Webhook active: https://your.company.com/webhook/convertalk-inbound
‚Ä¢	WhatsApp Buttons: Renew Plan, Check Ticket
‚Ä¢	Convertalk ‚Üí CRM Webhooks configured:
o	Renewal ‚Üí https://your.company.com/webhook/crm-renewal
o	Query ‚Üí https://your.company.com/webhook/crm-query
‚Ä¢	CRM REST logic ready:
o	update (Deal/Task) for Renewal
o	get (read) for Ticket Query
‚Ä¢	Convertalk replies to the client at the end of each branch.
‚Ä¢	Unified closing node in Convertalk IA Bot / Flow.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Final Note
The Convertalk ‚Üî Bitrix24 integration is now fully no-code and production-ready. All automation steps ‚Äî from lead mapping to deal management and service workflows ‚Äî can be configured directly through the Convertalk interface, with Bitrix24 serving as the CRM of record. Webhook configurations are still available available for advanced enterprise use cases, but standard users can now deploy full conversational CRM automation without writing a single line of code.
Final Validation
This document has been reviewed and finalized for publication. All sections maintain unified formatting and terminology consistent with Convertalk and Bitrix24 documentation standards. It is now ready for Mintlify Help Center or PDF corporate distribution.
